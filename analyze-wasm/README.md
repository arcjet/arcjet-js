[Arcjet][arcjet] helps developers protect their apps in just a few lines of
code. Implement rate limiting, bot protection, email verification, and defense
against common attacks.

This package provides WebAssembly bindings to [Arcjet's][arcjet] local analysis engine.

- [npm package (`@arcjet/analyze-wasm`)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcjet/analyze-wasm)
- [GitHub source code (`analyze-wasm/` in `arcjet/arcjet-js`)](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/tree/main/analyze-wasm)

## What is this?

This package provides logic in WebAssembly to locally analyze requests.

To load these binary files everywhere until something like
[_Import Bytes_][tc39-proposal-import-bytes] is available,
we settled on a technique that seems to work well everywhere.
This technique gives us compatibility with for example Next.js which right now
requires a special experimental `asyncWebAssembly` webpack configuration,

The file `_virtual/arcjet_analyze_js_req.component.core.js` contains the
WebAssembly inlined as a [`data:` URL][mdn-data-url].
This is about 3 times smaller than using a `Uint8Array` (see
[_Better Binary Batter: Mixing Base64 and Uint8Array_][wasm-base64-blog] for more
info).
That URL is then turned into an `ArrayBuffer` and passed to
`WebAssembly.compile`.

The files here are generated.
They are wrapped up into [`@arcjet/analyze`][github-arcjet-analyze] for use in
JavaScript,
in turn exposed in our core package
([`arcjet`][github-arcjet-arcjet])
and our adapters (such as `@arcjet/next`).

<!-- TODO(@wooorm-arcjet): link `adapters` above when the main repo is up to date. -->

## When should I use this?

This is an internal Arcjet package not designed for public use.
See our [_Get started_ guide][arcjet-get-started] for how to use Arcjet in your
application.

## Install

This package is ESM only.
Install with npm in Node.js:

```sh
npm install @arcjet/analyze-wasm
```

## Use

Use [`@arcjet/analyze`][file-analyze] instead.

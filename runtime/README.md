[Arcjet][arcjet] runtime detection.

This package attempts to discover and provide [runtime keys][runtime-keys] as
defined by the [WinterCG][wintercg].

- [npm package (`@arcjet/runtime`)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcjet/runtime)
- [GitHub source code (`runtime/` in `arcjet/arcjet-js`)](https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-js/tree/main/runtime)

## What is this?

This is an internal utility to help us figure out what platform we are running on.
It’s a fork of [`unjs/std-env`][std-env].
We chose to fork so that we can cut away functionality that we do not use
and keep our dependency tree as light as possible.
We only need the runtime detection.

## When should I use this?

You should not use this but use [`unjs/std-env`][std-env] or one of the
alternatives instead.
This package matches our current needs which are likely different from yours.

## Install

This package is ESM only.
Install with npm in Node.js:

```sh
npm install @arcjet/runtime
```

## Use

```ts
import { runtime } from "@arcjet/runtime";

console.log(runtime()); // => "bun" or "node" and such
```
